## Project Description

This project, **Chunk File**, is a project initiative introduced by a group of I4GxZuri internship trainees comprising of product designers, frontend developers and backend developers. Chunk File is a platform that accepts CSV or JSON large files and chunks them into smaller bits. It also allows users to save or download their files in zipped format anytime. **Chunking** is simply the process of splitting large files into smaller files called **chunks** without losing their content or quality.

### Chunk File Objectives

- Solve problems regarding issues of having large CSV and JSON files
- Allow user to split large CSV and JSON files
- Allow user to upload files to cloud and download later

### Chunk File Solutions

- Create means of chunking CSV and JSON files seamlessly for free
- Easily import, save and download CSV and JSON files anytime
- Splitting files into different sizes and numbers
